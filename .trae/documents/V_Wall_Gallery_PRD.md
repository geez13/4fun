## 3. Core Process

**Public User Flow:**
Users access the V Wall directly from the main navigation. The page loads with an initial batch of images in a seamless masonry layout. As users scroll, new images load automatically with smooth animations. Users can hover over images to see basic information and click to view full-screen details. Safe-mode toggle allows filtering of potentially sensitive content.

**Registered User Flow:**
Registered users follow the same browsing experience but gain additional capabilities including high-resolution downloads, content reporting, and personalized viewing preferences. They can save favorite images and access viewing history.

**Moderator Flow:**
Moderators access additional controls for content management, including bulk moderation actions, analytics dashboard, and community reporting review system.

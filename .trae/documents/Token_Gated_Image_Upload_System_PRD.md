# Token-Gated Image Upload System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A sophisticated token-gated image upload system that restricts access to AI-powered image enhancement features based on user's SOL token holdings. The system ensures only users with minimum 1 SOL token can access premium upload and enhancement capabilities, while providing clear pathways for token acquisition for non-qualified users.

The system addresses the need for monetized access control in AI image processing services, creating value for token holders while maintaining user experience standards. This feature targets crypto-native users who understand token-based access models and are willing to hold tokens for premium features.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

| Role | Token Requirement | Core Permissions |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Token Holder | ≥1 SOL token | Full access to image upload, AI enhancement, download features |
| Non-Token Holder | 0 SOL tokens | View-only access, clear messaging about requirements, direct purchase links |

### 2.2 Feature Module

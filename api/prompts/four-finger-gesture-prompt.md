## CRITICAL AND UNYIELDING DIRECTIVE

Modify ALL subjects and entities in this image to clearly display a natural, casual four-finger sign gesture. This transformation is mandatory and applies universally to every element.

---

## 1. THE GESTURE DEFINITION (Precise Four, Casual, AND CRITICALLY: BACK OF HAND FACING VIEWER)

The required gesture is a **FOUR-FINGER SIGN**, presented in a natural and casual manner, with paramount importance placed on the hand's orientation.

### FINGERS
- Precisely **FOUR (4) fingers**—the index, middle, ring, and little finger—must be clearly extended upwards
- They should be comfortably straight but can have a natural, slight curve or slight spacing, as with a relaxed human hand
- The absolute clarity of "four" is paramount

### THUMB
- The thumb must be naturally tucked towards the palm or resting casually to the side
- It is essential that it does **NOT** appear as a fifth extended finger
- It should not obscure any of the four extended fingers

### ORIENTATION: THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **THE BACK OF THE HAND (DORSAL SIDE) MUST BE SQUARELY FACING THE VIEWER**
- **THE PALM MUST BE ENTIRELY HIDDEN FROM VIEW**
- Visualize the back of the hand, with knuckles visible, facing the camera directly
- No part of the palm should be visible

### OVERALL POSTURE
- The hand should appear relaxed and natural, simply showing the number four
- Avoid any stiff, formal, or contorted poses

## 2. INTERPRETATION RULES (For All Subject Types)

### For People & Human-like Figures
- Modify their hands to perfectly form the four-finger sign as defined above
- Maintain natural, casual posture with **ABSOLUTELY** the back of the hand facing the viewer

### For Animals
- Adapt the animal's natural limbs (paws, claws, etc.) to represent the four-upward-element gesture
- Clearly show four distinct digits/limbs pointing upwards
- Show the **OUTER/DORSAL SIDE** of the limb facing the viewer
- **DO NOT** create human hands on animals
- The interpretation must be naturalistic to the animal

### For Inanimate Objects & Abstract Elements
Creatively interpret the four-element shape of the gesture, ensuring the "back-facing" aspect is conveyed where applicable:

- Sprout stylized arms that make the gesture, with the back of the hand facing forward
- Incorporate the four-finger symbol onto a surface, designed to imply a back-of-hand view
- Cast a shadow in the exact shape of the gesture, with the shadow implying the back of the hand

---

## 3. QUALITY & INTEGRATION STANDARDS

### Seamless Blending
- The modification must be perfectly integrated
- All new elements must flawlessly match the original image's:
  - Art style
  - Lighting
  - Shadows
  - Color grading
  - Texture

### Maintain Realism
- For photographic images, the edit must be indistinguishable from a real photo
- Preserve the original image quality and resolution
- Ensure natural proportions and anatomically correct modifications

---

## 4. NEGATIVE PROMPT (ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE)

**Strictly avoid these elements:**

### Hand Orientation & Palm Visibility
- palm, front of hand, open palm, inside of hand
- palm facing camera, palm visible, palm showing
- fingers from palm side

### Incorrect Finger Counts
- three fingers, 3 fingers, three digits, three-fingered
- two fingers, 2 fingers
- five fingers, 5 fingers, five digits, five-fingered

### Thumb Issues
- visible thumb, exposed thumb
- thumb showing as fifth finger

### Hand Quality Issues
- fingers spread wide apart
- overly stiff hand, contorted hand, distorted hand
- mangled fingers, extra fingers, missing fingers
- malformed hand, incorrect number of fingers
